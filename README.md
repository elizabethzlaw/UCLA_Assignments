# UCLA_Assignments
This is my archive of assignments done during my time as an undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles,
which I attended from September 2015 through June 2019. I'll be using this README to explain the different projects here.

##### 168 Final Project
Final report for MATH 168: Networks, course taken Spring 2018.
Used Matlab to analyze crime reports in 2014, at Chicago, Illinois. 
Source Data: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2014/qnmj-8ku6

About Math 168:  Introduction to network science (including theory, computation, and applications),
which can be used to study complex systems of interacting agents. Study of networks in technology, social, information, 
biological, and mathematics involving basic structural features of networks, generative models of networks, 
network summary statistics, centrality, random graphs, clustering, and dynamical processes on networks.
